**HOW TO USE**

1. Install (it will automatically set itself as default RTEditor for resources)
2. Start using it immediately
3. The plugin has only ten settings: click on the properties tab of the plugin

**What's in the package?**

1. One plugin
2. Four Chunks
3. Latest TinyMCE 4.2 untouched, unaltered - in fact, if you want to delete this folder, be my guest. Just use the provided CDN link.
4. Two free awesome homemade TinyMCE skins
5. Latest Responsive Filemanager 9.9.3 untouched, save for the config.php file that has only one line added to it.
6. Two config files to help configure the file manager


**Roadmap:**

- remove jQuery dependency
- create more awesome themes
- move wrapper plugin properties to System Settings or CMP or MIGX to avoid senseless cache-clearing by the plugin
- make plugin very much more faster

**Philosophy:**

- TinyMCE has the best community I can think of. In my opinion, this RTE is best.
- Keep TinyMCE's actual **init** absolutely apart from any form of PHP: all exposed to the user in readable chunks
- Allow users to do whatever they want with the actual TinyMCE plugin folder from Tinymce.com: to update or not to update
- Allow user to use existing compatible TinyMCE / custom filemanager plugins
- Do not obscure anything if possible
- Make it possible that any/all questions generated by this Wrapper can be asked and solved on the tinymce.com forum, that is, they have nothing to do with MODx
- Be beautiful, be simple!
