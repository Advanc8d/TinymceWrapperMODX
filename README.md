**HOW TO USE**
See http://www.leofec.com/modx-revolution/tinymce-wrapper-for-modx-manager.html

1. Install (it will automatically set itself as default RTEditor for resources)
2. Start using it immediately
3. The plugin has only ten settings: click on the properties tab of the plugin

**What's in the package?**

1. One plugin (TinyMCE_Wrapper)
2. Four Chunks (for Introtext, Decription, Content, and RichTVs textareas)
3. Latest TinyMCE 4.2 (untouched, unaltered) - in fact, if you want to delete this folder, be my guest. Just use the provided CDN link.
4. Two free awesome homemade TinyMCE skins
5. Latest Responsive Filemanager 9.9.3 (untouched, unaltered): to use with MODx just edit 2 lines in the config.php
6. One MODxized Responsive Filemanager config
7. One Responsive Filemanager personal folder config template


**Roadmap:**

- remove jQuery dependency
- create more awesome themes
- move wrapper plugin properties to System Settings or CMP or MIGX to avoid senseless cache-clearing by the plugin
- make plugin very much more faster

**Philosophy:**

- TinyMCE has the best community I can think of. In my opinion, this RTE is best.
- Keep TinyMCE's actual **init** absolutely apart from any form of PHP: all exposed to the user in readable chunks
- Allow users to do whatever they want with the actual TinyMCE plugin folder from Tinymce.com: to update or not to update
- Allow user to use existing compatible TinyMCE / custom filemanager plugins
- Do not obscure anything if possible
- Make it possible that any/all questions generated by this Wrapper can be asked and solved on the tinymce.com forum, that is, they have nothing to do with MODx
- Be beautiful, be simple, be fast!
