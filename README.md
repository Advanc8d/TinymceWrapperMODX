TinymceWrappper enables you to always use the latest TinyMCE (CDN or local) in your MODx Manager only.

The textareas: content, introtext, description, Rich Text / Image / File TVs will be transformed.
Any one of these can be turned off permanently or temporarily.

It has TinymceWrapper chunks which you can start using...you can use any TinyMCE configuration you like, NOTHING is hidden!

It comes with Responsive FileManager.

With a few lines of code, you can use MODx Media Source urls.
This Responsive FileManager is also standalone, you can use it without TinyMCE or MODx, that is, you can directly link to it.

Because we are using TinyMCE CDN and Responsive FileManager, NewsPublisher can use it too.
Just look at one of the TinymceWrapper chunks for sample init code.
