A TinyMCE Wrapper for MODx Revolution

Use freely, recode freely, report freely, enjoy freely

Nwadibia Designs (donshakespeare in the MODx forum)

****************Roadmap:
Remove jQuery dependency, create more awesome themes, move wrapper plugin properties to System Settings or CMP or MIGX, to avoid senseless cache-clearing by the plugin

****************Philosophy:
-TinyMCE has the best community I can think of. In my opinion, this RTE is best. Features in Redactor will be seen here soon
-Keep TinyMCE's actual init absolutely apart from any form of PHP: all exposed to the user in readable chunks
-Allow users to do whatever they want with the actual TinyMCE plugin folder from Tinymce.com: to update or not to update
-Allow user to use existing compatible TinyMCE / custom filemanager plugins
-Do not obscure anything if possible
-Make it possible that any/all questions generated by this Wrapper can be asked and solved on the tinymce.com forum, that is, they have nothing to do with MODx
-Be beautiful, be simple!
