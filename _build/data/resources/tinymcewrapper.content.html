<p>Hi there, I am secretary for TinyMCE 4.2, pleased to meet you. (hopefully installation went well)<br /><a href="http://forums.modx.com/thread/97694/support-comments-for-tinymcewrapper">http://forums.modx.com/thread/97694/support-comments-for-tinymcewrapper</a></p>
<p>I am clean and neat. Try pasting rubbish in here - yes, go ahead and copy an entire browser page and see what happens...<br />I obey only you, my master. Because you have set valid_elements,&nbsp;valid_children, and so on, I'll do my best to be awesome, and as strict as you are.</p>
<p><strong>QUICK UPDATE/CREATE RESOURCE<br /></strong>Go ahead and try it! Sweet, isn't it?<br />Open multiple windows, hit fullscreen on TinyMCE for distraction free editing<br />Use the <em>escape</em> key to close<br />Use <em>Ctrl+S</em> to save a particular modal window (not the background main resource)</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>SPELLCHECKER</strong><br />I even use your browser's spellchekcer. Right-click on that word and see what happens...</p>
<p><strong>Oops, I did not tell you</strong>, I have mousejacked your contextmenu, not really...I am just obeying you.<br />Go back to taht word hold the CTRL (for Wndows) and then right-click.</p>
<p><strong>RESOURCE LIST<br /></strong>Because you cannot drag resources into here, I have fetched&nbsp;your resources for you; go to chunk&nbsp;<strong>TinymceWrapperLinkList</strong> and change the parent I am supposed to be querying.<br />I am using <strong>pdoMenu extra</strong>, so be sure you have that, I did not want to invade you by auto installing it.<br />To test this, create a link now, go to link list.</p>
<p><strong>FILE MANAGER<br /><br /></strong>I tried using your MODx native File Manager, and my brain stopped computing. So instead, I am using the awesome Responsive Filemanager, which you can customize all you want.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>RFM</strong> should already be unzipped for you. <strong>Re-Unzip</strong> whenever you run into chaotic troubles<br /> If ever you do, please <strong>Copy</strong> all files in<strong> rfmConfigForModx-backup</strong> to<strong> filemanager/config/</strong></li>
<li>RFM should run <strong>automatically</strong> for you</li>
<li>To fully customize go to <strong>responsivefilemanager/filemanager/config/</strong></li>
<li><strong>config.modx.php</strong> - customise the upload/thumbs directory</li>
<li><strong>config.options.php</strong> - if you want to see all the possible but straightforward configurations for RFM</li>
<li>Survive upgrades by keeping a backup of all altered files.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is to&nbsp;demonstrate how independent the Responsive FileManager is from MODx or TinyMCE.</p>
<p>There is a lot we&nbsp;can do together...you can have custom CSS to reflect how elements show up on your live site, so that the blogger won't need a&nbsp;preview while typing.</p>
